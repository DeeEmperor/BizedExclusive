Build a one-page React + TailwindCSS website for a Nigerian luxury fashion designer.  
The site should have a *classy, minimalist, and modern* design — think black, white, gold accents, elegant serif headings, and smooth animations.

Include the following sections:

1. **Hero Section**
   - Full-screen background image with overlay text like “Elegance in Every Stitch.”
   - Include the designer’s name or logo.
   - Add a “View Collection” button that scrolls to the gallery.

2. **About Section**
   - Short paragraph about the designer’s story and fashion philosophy.
   - Use centered text, elegant spacing, and subtle fade-in animation.

3. **Gallery Section**
   - Display 6–8 outfit images in a clean responsive grid.
   - Each outfit card should have:
     - A photo
     - A name/title
     - A short description
     - A **“Order Now”** button that opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message.
       Example link: `https://wa.me/234XXXXXXXXXX?text=Hi!%20I'm%20interested%20in%20the%20[Outfit%20Name].`
   - Add hover effects (zoom-in and shadow) and smooth transitions.

4. **Testimonials Section**
   - 2–3 short client reviews with gold star icons.
   - Simple fade or slide animations as they scroll into view.

5. **Contact Section**
   - Include WhatsApp, Instagram, and phone number icons with hover glow effects.
   - Maybe a small thank-you message like “Let’s create something beautiful together.”

6. **Footer**
   - Black background, gold text.
   - Centered copyright and designer’s name.

**Design requirements:**
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.
- Use Framer Motion for smooth entrance animations.
- Font pairing: elegant serif for headings, modern sans-serif for body text.
- Color palette: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Gold (#D4AF37).
- Layout must look elegant and professional on both desktop and mobile.
- Add a fixed navbar with smooth scroll to each section.
- Keep the code clean, classy, and ready to deploy on Replit or Vercel.

Make it feel like a luxury fashion brand — minimalist but not boring.
